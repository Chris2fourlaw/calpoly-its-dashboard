# calpoly-its-dashboard

**Simple Electron App for displaying the status of Cal Poly services, phones, and tickets**

This application is used on a semi-headless Mac Mini (running Ubuntu) connected to 2 mirrored Thunderbolt displays at the Service Desk.
## Features

- Cycling dashboards (between Mitel Status, Aruba Dashboard, and a JSM Dashboard)
- Auto display on/off at open/close times (via Cronjob using [displayctl.sh](https://github.com/Chris2fourlaw/calpoly-its-dashboard/blob/main/scripts/displayctl.sh))
- Auto updating (via Cronjob using `git pull` and restarting app)
- Custom Service Desk opening/closing messages including daily checklists

## Future Features

- Alert pop-ups
  - Incident alerts through monitoring of #incidents Slack channel
  - Critical phone service issues (lack of agents)
  - Spike in recent tickets compared to baseline
- Better initial setup
  - Check if logged into Jira/Aruba before cycling through status
- A randomly selected funny cat photo at closing (Preston loves him some cat memes)
